#Chess Match in Goland (go_chess)

Aim:
The idea here is to create a game based on the logical concepts of chess.

Web Servcie:
A template for a web based application was imported. We will develop from here on.

TODO:
1. Change the logging on the application
2. Start the chess based process.
3. Most likely the channels and various "ways" of setting up interesting code in methods will allow this code to actually be something unique.
4. Go do some research on how to write a chess program
5. We can setup several interfaces and maps to map out the board and its "keys" as well as the various pieces and their inherent "move" options. 
    1. Might need to somehow set that up as classes.

Point based considerations:
1. Allow the user to play against a "AI"
2. Host this "game" as a web page.
3. Golang/python
4. Intractable - obviously.
5. I may want to introduce an aspect of intelligence here so the machine is able to beat me and maybe store the data from that in SQL. maybe NOSQL and MYSQL DB
6. SQLLite might be easier.
